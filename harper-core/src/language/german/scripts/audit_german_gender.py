"""Check the gender on German noun entries against the corpus that uses them.

Gender in `dictionary.dict` is wrong often enough to be unusable. Measured over
the 4000 most frequent nouns of the prose corpus, roughly one entry in fourteen
that carries a gender carries the wrong one, and the mistakes are systematic:
`Leber`, `Mauer`, `Dauer`, `Nummer`, `Ziffer`, `Metapher` and `Kammer` are
feminine and recorded masculine, `Tier`, `Heer`, `Meer`, `Papier`, `Fenster`,
`Kloster`, `Gewitter` and `Wetter` are neuter and recorded masculine. An `-er`
that was read as an agent noun accounts for most of it.

That is why `german_preposition_case.rs` narrows a determiner by number only.
Gender cannot be read until it can be trusted.

**The oracle is the text, not another dictionary.** A German article names the
gender of the noun it introduces, and a handful of article forms do so without
any competing reading:

    eine, einer                     -> feminine
    einen                           -> masculine
    das                             -> neuter
    dem, des, einem, eines, diesem, dieses, keinem, keines,
    meinem, meines, seinem, seines, ihrem, ihres, jedem, jedes
                                    -> masculine or neuter, never feminine

Everything else is ambiguous and is left out. `dieser` is nominative masculine
*and* dative feminine; `keine` is feminine singular *and* plural; `keinen` is
accusative singular *and* dative plural. Including `dieser` alone was enough to
make *Zeit* come out masculine, on 129 votes.

Two things in the text look like the pattern and are not, and each was found by
reading the disagreements:

* **A hyphenated compound.** *das Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal* votes for `Kaiser`
  unless the word after the noun is checked for a hyphen.
* **An indeclinable attributive adjective.** *das Londoner Abkommen* votes for
  `Londoner`, which is not the noun. A second capitalized word after the
  candidate rules it out.

**A second source, for the words the corpus cannot reach.** A few derivational
suffixes settle the gender on their own, and they were measured against the
corpus rather than assumed:

    -ung 99.5%   -tion -sion -ie -ismus -nis -ment 100%   -chen 92%   -um 90%

    -e 65%   -er 61%   -el 45%

Only the first row is used. The second is the rule that produced the damage in
the first place: an `-er` read as an agent-noun suffix is what made `Leber`,
`Mauer`, `Ziffer` and `Metapher` masculine.

**A third opinion, for validation only.** In igerman98 a headword with the
genitive `-es` flag `T` is never feminine, and one carrying `F` or `g` — the
`-in` derivation — is masculine, since a feminine does not derive a feminine.
That is sharp enough to contradict, not sharp enough to decide: it mislabels
`-ismus` nouns, whose genitive is uninflected, and umlaut-plural compound
elements. Disagreements are printed; nothing is written from it.

Note the trap in the dictionary itself: `de_DE.aff` declares `SET ISO8859-1`
while the `.dic` beside it is UTF-8, so every word with an umlaut fails to
analyse *quietly*. Copy the `.aff`, rewrite that one line, leave the `.dic`.

Usage:

    audit_german_gender.py --corpus .archive/german-language/corpus-prose
    audit_german_gender.py --corpus <dir> --apply   # fix contradicted genders
    audit_german_gender.py --corpus <dir> --add     # fill in missing ones

Without `--apply` or `--add` nothing is written.
